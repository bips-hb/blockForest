## blockForest: Random Forests for Blocks of Clinical and Omics Covariate Data

Roman Hornung, Marvin N. Wright

### Description

A random forest variant suitable for the prediction of binary, survival
and continuous outcomes using multi-omics data, i.e., data for which
measurements of different types of omics data and/or clinical data for
each patient exist. Examples include gene expression measurements,
methylation measurements, and copy number variation measurements.
