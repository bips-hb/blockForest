## blockForest: Random Forests for Blocks of Clinical and Omics Covariate Data
Roman Hornung, Marvin N. Wright

### Description
A random forest variant suitable for the prediction of binary, survival and continuous outcomes using multi-omics data, i.e., data for which measurements of different types of omics data and/or clinical data for each patient exist. Examples include gene expression measurements, methylation measurements, and copy number variation measurements.
